// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = " The second step, in seeing what conditions the new code need to meet and how they will be met."
const design = `The third step is when the team make a rough draft of the code, usally having one person saying what needs to be met, while another is writing down way to achive the end goal like on a piece of paper. `
const implementation = `The fourth step is when the team sits down and starts typing going off the rought draft and trying to make it run accordingly.`
const testingAndIntergration = "The fith step is when you have a outside team come in and try to use the code in way you wouldn't have thought of, some may even try to break it like in game design, then if all goes well you send it out to let it be used by the web."
const maintain = `The final step is when you keep a eye on the code to see if anything happens or just to keep it up to date.`
